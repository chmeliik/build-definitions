# 🤝 Shared CI setup for Konflux Task repos

Some of the CI scripts and workflows in this repo come from the [task-repo-shared-ci]
template repo.

All the files that come from the template repo have a `<TEMPLATED FILE!>` comment
near the top to help identify them.

## 🍏 Updating the shared CI

Use [`cruft`][cruft] to update the shared CI files to the latest template:

```bash
cruft update --skip-apply-ask --allow-untracked-files
```

Don't forget to commit the `.cruft.json` changes as well to track which
version of the templates you have.

> [!TIP]
> If you have [`uv`][uv] installed, you can run `uvx cruft` and don't need
> to install `cruft` itself.

Your repo also has an automated workflow that periodically checks for updates and
sends automated PRs. See [Shared CI Updater](#shared-ci-updater) for more details.

## 🔧 Making changes

You can edit the shared CI files if necessary, but please consider sending PRs
for the upstream [task-repo-shared-ci] templates to reduce drift and so that
others can benefit from the changes as well.

`cruft` *will* try to respect your custom patches during the update process, but
as you make more local changes you increase the chance of merge conflicts.

## ☑️ CI workflows

### Trusted Artifacts

- script: [`hack/generate-ta-tasks.sh`](hack/generate-ta-tasks.sh)
  - Generates Trusted Artifacts variants of Tasks. See below for more details.
- workflow: [`.github/workflows/check-ta.yaml`](.github/workflows/check-ta.yaml)
  - Checks that the Trusted Artifacts variants are up to date with their base Tasks.

With Trusted Artifacts (TA), Tasks share files via the use of archives stored in
an image repository and not using attached storage (PersistentVolumeClaims). This
has performance and usability benefits. For more details, see
[ADR36](https://konflux-ci.dev/architecture/ADR/0036-trusted-artifacts.html).

When authoring a Task that needs to share or use files from another Task, the
task author can opt to include the Trusted Artifact variant, by convention in
the `${task_name}-oci-ta` directory. This is necessary for the Task to be usable
in Pipelines that make use of Trusted Artifacts.

To author a Trusted Artifacts variant of a Task, create the `${task_name}-oci-ta`
directory, define a [`recipe.yaml`][recipe.yaml] inside the directory and generate
the TA variant using the [`hack/generate-ta-tasks.sh`](hack/generate-ta-tasks.sh)
script. See the [trusted-artifacts generator] README for more details.

### Shared CI Updater

- workflow: [`.github/workflows/update-shared-ci.yaml`](.github/workflows/update-shared-ci.yaml)

Periodically (every Sunday, by default) checks for updates in the [task-repo-shared-ci]
templates and sends automated PRs.

You can also trigger it manually from the Actions tab of your repo.

> [!NOTE]
> If you've made custom edits to your shared CI files, then the update process
> can encounter merge conflicts. When that happens, the workflow will send the
> PR anyway but with the merge conflicts included. The PR will be in draft state
> and will include a caution note (like this one, but red) with instructions.

#### Required secrets

- `SHARED_CI_UPDATER_APP_ID` - the ID of the updater GitHub app
- `SHARED_CI_UPDATER_PRIVATE_KEY` - the private key for the updater GitHub app

These may already be set globally for your organization. If not, see the instructions
below.

#### Updater GitHub app

The update workflow uses the credentials of a GitHub app to create pull requests,
rather than the default [`GITHUB_TOKEN`][GITHUB_TOKEN]. There are two reasons:

1. PRs created using `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot trigger `on: pull_request` or `on: push`
   workflows
2. It's not possible to grant `GITHUB_TOKEN` the permission to edit `.github/workflows/`
   files

Since the shared CI updater is *all about* workflows, it needs to use app credentials
to avoid those restrictions.

##### Set up the GitHub app

1. Go to your organization or user settings on GitHub
2. Go to `Developer settings` > `GitHub Apps`
3. Click `New GitHub App`.
4. Configure the app:
   - **GitHub App name**: e.g. `${org_name} shared CI updater`
   - **Homepage URL**: <https://github.com/chmeliik/task-repo-shared-ci/blob/main/SHARED-CI.md#shared-ci-updater>
   - **Webhook**: uncheck the `☑️ Active` option
   - **Permissions**:
     - **Repository permissions**:
        - Contents: `Read and write`
        - Pull requests: `Read and write`
        - Workflows: `Read and write`

##### Set the required secrets

1. On the app's settings page, copy the App ID number and generate a private key
2. Go to your organization settings (to set the secrets org-wide)
   or your repository settings
3. Go to `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`
4. Create the secrets
   - `SHARED_CI_UPDATER_APP_ID`: the App ID number
   - `SHARED_CI_UPDATER_PRIVATE_KEY`: plaintext content of the private key
